Let's talk about Dependency injection before we move to services
## Dependency injection
Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself. It's a very useful technique for testing, since it allows dependencies to be mocked or stubbed out.

And this take us to services Sections

## Services 
A service is an instance of class that will be injected using the Injector whenever we need it
